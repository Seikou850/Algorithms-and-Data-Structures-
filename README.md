# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-

Throughout the algorithms and data structure unit, I was introduced to a range of fundamental algorithms and data structures that are essential to solving computational challenges in the fields of data science and machine learning. One of the primary objectives of the unit was to help me understand and evaluate algorithm complexity and efficiency. I gained hands-on experience in implementing algorithms using different data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and trees.

The unit also covered graph theory, graph algorithms, and graph search. I learned how to represent and manipulate graphs, traverse them efficiently, and apply graph algorithms to solve real-world problems. Through practical assignments and projects, I was able to apply my knowledge and skills to solve computational challenges.

As part of my portfolio, I included videos that demonstrate my understanding of the code and the step-by-step processes involved in implementing these algorithms and data structures. These videos provide a detailed explanation of how the code works and how it solves specific computational problems. I have included these videos in a folder labeled "Screencast 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5" within my portfolio.

By including these videos, I was able to showcase my ability to communicate complex technical concepts to a wider audience. They also provide evidence of my proficiency in implementing algorithms and data structures, as well as my ability to explain and analyze their performance.

By the end of the unit, I had a solid understanding of how algorithms and data structures can be used to solve problems. I feel well-equipped to tackle more complex challenges in the field of data science and machine learning. Overall, this unit was a valuable learning experience, and I am excited to continue exploring the application of algorithms and data structures in my future studies and career.
