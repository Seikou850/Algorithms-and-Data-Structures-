#Algorithms and Data Structures

I loved learning about algorithms and data structures in this unit. It was amazing to see how these fundamental concepts can be used to solve complex problems in the real world.

One of the things I enjoyed most was the hands-on experience. I implemented algorithms using different data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, and trees. I also learned about graph theory, graph algorithms, and graph search. Through practical assignments and projects, I was able to apply my knowledge and skills to solve computational challenges.

I'm particularly proud of the screencasts I created as part of my portfolio. These videos demonstrate my understanding of the code and the step-by-step processes involved in implementing these algorithms and data structures. They provide a detailed explanation of how the code works and how it solves specific computational problems.

By including these videos, I was able to showcase my ability to communicate complex technical concepts to a wider audience. They also provide evidence of my proficiency in implementing algorithms and data structures, as well as my ability to explain and analyse their performance.

By the end of the unit, I had a solid understanding of how algorithms and data structures can be used to solve problems. I feel well-equipped to tackle more complex challenges in the field of data science and machine learning. Overall, this unit was a valuable learning experience, and I'm excited to continue using my knowledge in my future studies and career.
